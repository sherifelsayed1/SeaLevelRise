Sea level rise, is considered one of the big contributors to climate change.
Accordingly, many satellite missions are sent into space with the purpose of monitoring this phenomena.
The story started in 1992, with launch of TOPEX/Poseidon. Afterwards, many space agencies started to follow up and sent further satellites.
That helped in extending the measurments since that time and provide also different sensors that perform the same measurmetns.
In this project, measurments from jason and envisat satellites are both considered for the computation.
